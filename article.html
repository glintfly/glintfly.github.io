        title: "Gibson Girl & Society",
        articleText: `In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the "Gibson Girl" emerged as an iconic representation of the ideal American woman. Created by illustrator Charles Dana Gibson, she was depicted as tall, slender, and elegant, often engaged in leisure activities. The Gibson Girl embodied a blend of traditional femininity and newfound independence. She was portrayed as educated and socially active, yet still adhering to societal expectations of modesty and decorum. This image influenced women's fashion, leading to high-necked blouses, long skirts, and upswept hairstyles. While the Gibson Girl symbolized a progressive shift towards women's autonomy, she also reinforced certain class and racial exclusivities, primarily representing affluent white women. Nonetheless, the Gibson Girl played a significant role in shaping early 20th-century perceptions of femininity and women's evolving roles in society.`,

        articleText: `Between 1865 and 1945, American society experienced significant transformations, leading to evolving standards of etiquette. The post-Civil War era emphasized Victorian ideals, where strict social codes dictated behavior, dress, and communication. As urbanization and industrialization progressed, these rigid norms began to relax. The 1920s introduced more liberal attitudes, with jazz music, dance halls, and flapper culture challenging traditional decorum. Technological advancements, such as the telephone and automobile, altered social interactions. Despite these changes, certain formalities persisted, especially in conservative communities. By 1945, etiquette had become a blend of old-world manners and modern informality.`,

        title: "Tradition vs. Innovation",
        articleText: `The period from 1865 to 1945 in America was marked by a tension between tradition and innovation. Post-Civil War reconstruction aimed to restore traditional Southern values, yet the nation was simultaneously embracing industrialization. The late 19th century saw inventions like the telephone, light bulb, and automobile revolutionize daily life. While some Americans clung to established customs, others eagerly adopted new technologies and lifestyles. The 1920s epitomized this clash: traditionalists upheld Prohibition and conservative morals, while innovators celebrated flapper culture, jazz music, and speakeasies. The Great Depression prompted a return to certain traditional values, emphasizing frugality and community support. However, World War II spurred further shifts, ultimately blending tradition with innovation.`,
